## My process

### Built with

- Figma Design
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile First
- Semantic GIT commits

### What I learned

Improve my skills in Figma, assembling the layout in a much shorter time than before.
I learned a little about semantic commits, assigning an identification tag to the type of operation performed, for example:
- FEAT - Indicates that a new feature is included
- FIX - Indicates that you are solving a problem (bug fix)
- DOCS - indicates a change in documentation (such as README)
- TEST - Indicates a change in tests
- BUILD - For modifying build files and dependencies
- RERF - Indicate code changes related to performance
- STYLE - Indicate code formatting changes, semicolons, trailing spaces, lint...
- CHORE - Indicate update of build tasks, settings, packages... (eg add a package to gitignore)
- CI - Indicate changes related to continuous integration
- REFACTOR - refers to recurring refactoring changes

### Continued development

For future projects I want to try using:
- SASS
- React
